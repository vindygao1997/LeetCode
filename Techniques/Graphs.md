# Graph

# Number of connected components in an undirected graph

1. Everytime you see a `list` of `pairs` like [ [1,2], [2,3], [3,1] ], you can consider it as a graph, because it is meant to represent the relationship between `nodes`: 1 has an edge to 2, 2 has an edge to 3, etc
2. There could be different `clusters` or `island` of nodes
